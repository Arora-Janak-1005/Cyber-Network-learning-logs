# Cyber-Network-learning-logs
This repo documents my ongoing learning in networking and cybersecurity. I started documenting from the middle, focusing on concepts, labs, and mistakes.
## Current Focusing Topics:
- Routing Protocols
- TCP/IP internals
- Linux Networking tool
- Packet Analysis(Wireshark)
## Structure
- /concepts – theory explained simply
- /labs – hands-on experiments
- /reflections – what confused me & what clicked
