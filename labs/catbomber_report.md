the infected system ip : 10.5.28.229
# http get stream:

```
GET / HTTP/1.1

Connection: Keep-Alive

User-Agent: curl/7.69.1

from this above given stream we can note a few things :
1. the agent name is just ***curl/7.69.1*** this is usually a longer string when a normal user uses a browser { first indication that something is wrong}
2. the name of the server is ***cowboy***.
3. it is returning a ip that is not recognizable although we checked the ip and here it is not being visited
