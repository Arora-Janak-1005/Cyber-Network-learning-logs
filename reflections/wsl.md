## CONFUSION:
- the main confusions during setting this was the github part...i was not able to connect the debian i installed to the github repo.
many windows commands were also not  running in te debian .


##REFLECTIONS:
- i was able to figure out the problems were majorly due to updates and the paths to which i was not typing correctly
