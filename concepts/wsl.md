# Learned WSL 2 framework of the windows
wsl 2 or windows subsystem for linux is a powerful virtualization software for installing linux on a running windows , though specifically on windows 11 and widows 10 (build 19401 & above)
- It allows you to run a  linux  box on a  very lightweight hypervisor system.
- To install wsl launch the powershell in administrator user and then write : 'wsl --install'
- You can install almost every famous linux distro out there like (kali, ubuntu(default),debian,fedora,etc). You can see the list out there y using command:'wsl --list --online'
- You can also use a vast array of tools in it just like a normal linux box, for eg. tools like ssh , tcpdump, wireshark, etc.
