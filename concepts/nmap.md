## Nmap:
- used to gain information over the network about the hosts , ports and services running
- ping stands for packet internet proofer
## Commands for nmap:
- -sn for ping(host up, mac addr)
- -Pn is a switch if the ping probes are being dropped by the server.
- -sn --traceroute FQDN
- 

# if we have firewall up to evade firewall we can use ARP
- we will send a particular arp request to the victim and in return it will send the mac address meaning that it is in on state and responding on the internet
- we can use switches -sn ip -PR
## More things i learnt during this session:
- hop on the router stand for host of/on the point
